# Stroke-Predictor
## Context
This project is a school broject that aims to build a Machine Learning web app deploying it into a composition of multiple containers. The app objectif of the app is
to predict if a patient is susceptible to have a heart stroke given multiple features and charachteristics about his person, health and lifestyle.

## How to use it
We used a Docker Compose tu wire up the multiple dockerized parts of the project (backend and frontend)

All you have to do is to run the ``docker compose up`` command line since the images are hosted in the docker hub, then you can access the main page where you'd 
introduce the features of the patient you'd like to predict
